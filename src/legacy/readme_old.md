For now, it is recommended to clone Bellatrex from git instead of installing it with pip, as we need the latest development version for this explorer tool to work.  Clone and install the Bellatrex repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Klest94/Bellatrex.git
cd Bellatrex
pip install -e .
```
